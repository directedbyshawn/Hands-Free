'''
	ML Group 8
	The goal of this portion of the project is focused on detecting edges of the road.
	This may be extended to lane detection, rather than just road edgeline detection.
	The ability to detect where the edges of the road are or where one's lane is, is an
	important component of autonomous driving. It is the core of having a car drive on its
	own.
